      Suicides rates up 30 percent from 1999, according to CDC report

      Suicide is a leading cause of death in the U.S. According to a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/suicide/" target="_blank">report</a> put out by the Center for Disease Control in June of this year, the suicide rate has risen 30 percent since 1999. Suicide rates increased in every single state except for Nevada.
    </p>
    <p class="body-copy">
      The report from the CDC came out just two days after the death of fashion designer <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/05/us/kate-spade-dead/index.html" target="_blank">Kate Spade</a> and the day of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/08/us/anthony-bourdain-obit/index.html" target="_blank">Anthony Bourdain's</a> death. The deaths of two accomplished figures in the span of a week brought national attention to these <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/preventable-tragedies" target="_blank">preventable tragedies</a>, but suicide is still a taboo subject.
      </p>
    <p class="body-copy">
      Suicide rates have only been rising since 1999, when then-Surgeon General David Satcher in a <a href="https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/ResourceMetadata/NNBBHS" target="_blank">report </a>called suicide "a significant public health issue." In 2016 alone, nearly <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/suicide/" target="_blank">45,000</a> people died by suicide.
    </p>
    <h2>Suicide is affecting young adults, too</h2>
    <p class="body-copy">
      Suicide rates for all age groups have increased, not just adults. Young adult suicides have also climbed in recent years. From 2000 to 2016, suicide was the third-leading cause of death for young people aged 10 to 24, and the second-leading cause of death for young women aged 10 to 24.

    <p class="body-copy">
      Every single young adult age group saw a rise in the crude rate of suicides per 100,000. From 2000 to 2016, suicide crude rates for young adults age 10 to 24 increased 34 percent. The starkest increase was in the age group 10 to 14, where the crude rate increased 46 percent, from 1.45 per 100,000 to 2.11 per 100,000.

    <h2>Rates of suicide uneven across States</h2>
    <p class="body-copy">
      Suicides rates across the States is uneven, with some states experiencing a greater number of suicides per 100,000 than others. Over the period 2008 to 2014, the annualized crude rate of suicide for young adults in the U.S. was 7.7 per 100,000. Alaska had the highest rate of suicide at 25.9 per 100,000 and New Jersey had the lowest at 4.9 per 100,000.

    <p class="body-copy">
      Even more shocking statistics from the CDC report came from the number of suicides among people with no diagnosed mental health condition. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/nvdrs/index.html" target="_blank">National Violent Death Reporting System</a>, which is used by 27 states, reported that 54 percent of suicides fell into that category. This number, however, can be misleading.
    </p>
    <p class="body-copy">
      According to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/06/07/u-s-suicide-rates-rise-sharply-across-the-country-new-report-shows/?utm_term=.7af2aee106f8" target="_blank">Washington Post article</a> from June, Joshua Gordon, director of the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/index.shtml">National Institute of Mental Health</a>, said psychological autoposies of people who have died by suicide reveal that "90 percent will have evidence of a mental health condition."
    </p>
    <h2>American Indians, Males most likely to die by suicide</h2>
    <p class="body-copy">
      Multiple reports have shown that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6708a1.htm" target="_blank">American Indians</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/suicide/racial_and_gender_2009_2013.htm" target="_blank">males</a> are most likely to die by suicide than any other group. While there has been no concrete correlation between any specific factors, theories exist.
    </p>
    <p class="body-copy">
      One theory known as the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9560163" target="_blank">Gender Paradox in Suicide</a> looks at the statistics around depression and gender. While women tend to be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4478054/"target="_blank">more depressed</a> than men, men are more likely to take their own lives, young adult men included. The paradox focuses on the cultural expections of suicide and gender. Young men are supposed to bury their feelings while women are encouraged to be open about their feelings. This cultural expectation that young men should "be manly" by showing no emotion might be a factor in why they are more likely to die by suicide.
